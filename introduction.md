ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM

This project is a food delivery system built using Python and MySQL. It simulates a basic version of platforms like Swiggy or Zomato, allowing users to register, view a menu, place orders, and view their order history.

The system uses three core tables:

Users – to store customer information

Menu – to list available food items with prices

Orders – to track what each user ordered and in what quantity

The Python program interacts with the MySQL database using mysql-connector-python. It offers a simple command-line interface that guides users through all functionalities in an intuitive way.

Overall, the project provides hands-on experience in database creation, SQL querying, and Python-MySQL integration—making it a perfect starting point for beginners in backend development.
